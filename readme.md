CaptionThis, by David Parker and Jessica Rinks, is a website where users compete to write the best caption to a daily cute animal image. 
The website displays a daily image (pulled from a third party API) and users can post a caption for that image as well as vote for that day's best caption. 
Users can register, login, and update their user info, view all submitted captions, post their own caption and vote on their favorite caption. 
Users who aren't registered or logged in can view the landing page that shows the daily image and the most recent four posts. 
The website also has a Winners page where past daily images and past winners are displayed.
